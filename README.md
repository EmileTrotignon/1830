# 1830
A helper to play 1830 : Robber Barons. Could become a whole adaptation.

1830 : Robber Barons is a train-themed board game, and the late game require a lot of repetive calculation that are not really
important or strategic. This python modules should do them for you.
The structure of the program is done, although the interface and assets are not complete.
It uses the graph library that is on my GitHub as well.
